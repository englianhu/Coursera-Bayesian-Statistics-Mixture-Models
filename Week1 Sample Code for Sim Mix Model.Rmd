# 受講生によるテストの実施：Simulating from a Mixture Model

## 説明

Consider the code provided in the lesson "Sample code for simulating from a Mixture Model":

```{r error=TRUE}
# Sample code for simulating from a Mixture Model
# Generate n observations from a mixture of two Gaussian 
# distributions
n     = 50           # Size of the sample to be generated
w     = c(0.6, 0.4)  # Weights
mu    = c(0, 5)      # Means
sigma = c(1, 2)      # Standard deviations
cc    = sample(1:2, n, replace=T, prob=w)
x     = rnorm(n, mu[cc], sigma[cc])

# Plot f(x) along with the observations 
# just sampled
xx = seq(-5, 12, length=200)
yy = w[1]*dnorm(xx, mu[1], sigma[1]) + 
  w[2]*dnorm(xx, mu[2], sigma[2])
par(mar=c(4,4,1,1)+0.1)
plot(xx, yy, type="l", ylab="Density", xlab="x", las=1, lwd=2)
points(x, y=rep(0,n), pch=1)
```

*Source : [Coursera-Bayesian-Statistics-Mixture-Models/Week1 Sample Code for Sim Mix Model.R](https://github.com/englianhu/Coursera-Bayesian-Statistics-Mixture-Models/blob/main/Week1%20Sample%20Code%20for%20Sim%20Mix%20Model.R)*

Modify the code above to sample 200 random numbers from a mixture of 3 Poisson distributions with means 1, 2 and 6 and weights 0.7, 0.2 and 0.1, respectively, and generate a barplot with the empirical frequencies of all the integers included in the sample.

### Review criteria

The response should follow the same template as the sample code provided above.  Peer reviewers will be asked to check whether the different pieces of code have been adequately modified to reflect the fact that (1) you are working now with 3 components rather than 2, (2) that the components of the mixture are Poisson distributions rather than Gaussians, (3) that the empirical frequencies associated with the sample generated are correctly computed, (4) that a barplot is used to represent the empirical frequencies.

**Is the sampling of the indicator variables done correctly?**

The line

**Assuming that the indicator variables have been correctly sampled, are the observations being sampled correctly?**

The line

**Are the empirical frequencies computed correctly?**

The code used to compute the frequencies should look something like

```{r error=TRUE}
empfreq = table(factor(x, levels=seq(0, max(x))))/n
empfreq
```

The main difficulty here is how to properly compute the frequencies using R, rather than anything that is specific to mixture models.  Using the function `table()` directly on the vector $x$ will ignore values with zero counts. Similarly, the function `tabulate()` will ignore the $x = 0$ case. First converting the vector $x$ into a factor while ensuring that any integer between 0 and the maximum in the sample are valid factors avoids the issue.

- 0点 No
- 1点 Yes for some datasets, but might fail. Use this category if, for example, the function table was used directly on $x$,

```{r error=TRUE}
empfreq = table(x)/n
empfreq
```

Partial credit should also be given if counts rather than frequencies are reported (i.e., if the answer does not divide by $n$).

- <span style='color:green'>2点 Yes</span>

**Does the barplot appear correct?**

The code should be something like 

```{r error=TRUE}
barplot(empfreq)
```

or

```{r error=TRUE}
hist(x, right=F)
```

When using the hist function, the option right=F  must be specified so that the intervals/bins are specified correctly. This ensures that the intervals are [0,1), [1,2),...,[10,11]. Note that the last interval is a closed one. In the default setting (right=T), the first category [0,1] is closed. That is, the left and right endpoints are included.
